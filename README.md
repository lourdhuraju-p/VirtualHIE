<b>Problem Statement</b><br>Health is major concern these days and with Smart city initiative, the concern is being dealt in a nice manner. Government is concerned about giving quality health to all individuals but there are many challenges in doing so. Some of the key challenges are:
<br><ul><li>Can patients go to multiple Physicians and hospitals to take care of same problem?</li>
<li>Can a patient send all the previous record to other hospital?</li>
<li>Do patients know which Doctor or Clinic or Hospital to go to for health related issues?</li>
<li>Is there a solution to it?</li>
<li>Yes and the answer is setting up state level HIEs</li>
</ul>
<b>What is HIE</b><br>
Electronic health information exchange (HIE) allows doctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health care providers and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient’s vital medical information electronically—improving the speed, quality, safety and cost of patient care.
<ul> 
<li>Every state can have their own HIE and can have all hospitals participate in the HIE program to share patient’s records.</li>
<li>HIEs are single source of collating all patient records from disparate sources and act as an mediator between various hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Advantages of HIE</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Improves public health reporting and monitoring</li>
<li>Provides the backbone of technical infrastructure for leverage by national and State-level initiatives</li>
<li>Provides a basic level of interoperability among various sources of patient data maintained by individual physicians and organizations</li>
<li>Stimulates consumer education and patients' involvement in their own health care</li>
<li>Increases efficiency by eliminating unnecessary paperwork</li>

</ul>
