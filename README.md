"# Health is major concern these days and with Smart city initiative, the concern is being dealt in a nice manner. Government is concerned about giving quality health to all individuals but there are many challenges in doing so. Some of the key challenges are:

<br>Can patients go to multiple Physicians and hospitals to take care of same problem?
<br>Can a patient send all the previous record to other hospital?
<br>Do patients know which Doctor or Clinic or Hospital to go to for health related issues?
<br>Is there a solution to it?
<br>Yes and the answer is setting up state level HIEs
