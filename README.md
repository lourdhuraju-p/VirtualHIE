<b>Problem Statement</b><br>Health is major concern these days and with Smart city initiative, the concern is being dealt in a nice manner. Government is concerned about giving quality health to all individuals but there are many challenges in doing so. Some of the key challenges are:
<br><ul><li>Can patients go to multiple Physicians and hospitals to take care of same problem?</li>
<li>Can a patient send all the previous record to other hospital?</li>
<li>Do patients know which Doctor or Clinic or Hospital to go to for health related issues?</li>
<li>Is there a solution to it?</li>
<li>Yes and the answer is setting up state level HIEs</li>
</ul>
<b>What is HIE</b><br>
Electronic health information exchange (HIE) allows doctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health care providers and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient’s vital medical information electronically—improving the speed, quality, safety and cost of patient care.
<ul> 
<li>Every state can have their own HIE and can have all hospitals participate in the HIE program to share patient’s records.</li>
<li>HIEs are single source of collating all patient records from disparate sources and act as an mediator between various hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Advantages of HIE</b>
<ul>
<li>Improves public health reporting and monitoring</li>
<li>Provides the backbone of technical infrastructure for leverage by national and State-level initiatives</li>
<li>Provides a basic level of interoperability among various sources of patient data maintained by individual physicians and organizations</li>
<li>Stimulates consumer education and patients' involvement in their own health care</li>
<li>Increases efficiency by eliminating unnecessary paperwork</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Proposed Solution</b>
<ul>
<li>The proposed solution creates a state level HIE. The state level HIE will be governed as per the state’s Department of Health.</li>
<li>Another dependency can be from Department of Health’ directions from the Union Government of India.</li>
<li>The HIE body comprises of Admins who can contact all participating hospital’s Admin/Physician Directors.</li>
<li>HIE has a portal where HIE Admin can login to start new participation from hospitals in the state and other hospital Admins can login to request/send patient information.</li>
<li>Each transaction will be done digitally and in a secured environment to maintain the security and privacy of patient records.</li>
</ul>
